## About Me

I am a computer science student with a strong interest in core programming, data structures, and system-level concepts. I enjoy building practical projects that emphasize clarity, correctness, and clean design rather than unnecessary complexity.

My goal is to continuously improve my problem-solving ability while developing reliable and well-documented software.
